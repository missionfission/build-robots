## Common Features

Each robot example includes:
- URDF/XACRO model with proper physical properties
- Launch files for simulation and visualization
- Sensor configurations and driver implementations
- Control algorithms and behavior definitions
- Documentation and usage instructions

## Getting Started

1. Choose a robot category and specific example
2. Follow the README in the robot's directory
3. Launch the simulation using provided launch files
4. Experiment with different configurations and parameters

## Contributing

To add a new robot example:
1. Create a new directory in the appropriate category
2. Include URDF/XACRO files for the robot model
3. Add necessary launch files and configurations
4. Provide comprehensive documentation
5. Test in simulation and verify functionality
